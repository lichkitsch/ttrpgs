# _dnduet_ Short Rules

## Step 1 - Make a Character
Players roleplay as a character living in the fictional world of the game, which is controlled by the game master.

Characters are made up of the following:

| Name | Description |
|:---:|:--- |
| Level | Representation of the character's effectiveness on a scale of 1 to 12; decides what dice are used for effect rolls |
| Heart Points (HP) | A representation of a character's physical, mental, and emotional integrity; max HP starts at `10+CON` |
| Stats | Representation of the character's strengths and weaknesses; added to action rolls when appropriate, stats start at `1d4-2` |
| <span title="strength">`STR`</span> | power, muscle, athletics, melee |
| <span title="dexterity">`DEX`</span> | reflexes, agility, stealth, finesse |
| <span title="constitution">`CON`</span> | stamina, endurance, reroll HP |
| <span title="intelligence">`INT`</span> | knowledge, memory, logic |
| <span title="wisdom">`WIS`</span> | perception, intuition, accuracy |
| <span title="charisma">`CHA`</span> | influence, performance, allure |
| Virtue | A positive personality trait |
| Trait | A neutral personality trait |
| Flaw | A negative personality trait |
| History | Describes the character's background; where the character comes from |
| Motive | The character's driving force or primary goal in life |
| Inventory | A list of the items the character is carrying on their person |
| Perk | A specific circumstance when you can roll a chosen stat twice and keep the higher result |
| Quirk | A specific circumstance when you must roll a chosen stat twice and keep the lower result |

## Step 2 - Play the Game

Characters interact with the game world by making choices, talking to NPCs, and rolling dice.

| Roll Type | Used when... | Dice |
|:---:|:--- |:---:|
| Action | The outcome of an action is uncertain; add most relevant stat score, result must be >= the _Air of Fate_ for a positive outcome | `1d20` |
| Contest | The action is targeting a creature that can also act; both actor and target roll, highest wins, actor wins in a tie | `1d20` |
| Effect | The obstacle or task in question has HP; roll to reduce/replenish HP | Variable |

The _Air of Fate_ is a number between 3 and 18 that represents the level of challenge the character is facing in their current situation, set by the game master. Contest rolls must be explained on both sides before the  dice are rolled, i.e. the actor is swinging an axe and the target is dodging the attack. When an obstacle's HP reaches 0, the obstacle is overcome and the player can move forward. 

During short rests, while the character is safe from danger, the player can make ah effect roll to replenish some HP. After a full night's sleep, the character returns to  max HP.

If a character's HP reaches 0, they fall unconscious and the game master makes something bad happen to them, but they only die if the player believes it improves the narrative. Upon character death, the player can continue the game as an NPC or end the story, possibly with an epilogue.

## Step 3 - Level Up
After significant milestones or important victories the player can level to their character using the following steps:

1. Add 1 point to any stat score, no more than 5 points to a stat
2. Increase max HP using table below
3. Check chart below for new effect dice
4. If necessary, modify the character's perk and/or quirk
