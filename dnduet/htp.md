# dnduet

_dnduet_ is a system for creating and playing custom tabletop RPGs, optimized for one player and one game master (GM). The player is responsible for the story's protagonist(s), and the GM is responsible for just about everything else. Play is taken in turns: the GM presents the scene, environment, non-player characters (NPCs), etc. and the player character (PC) makes choices that move the plot forward.

## Player Guide

Characters in _dnduet_ games have character sheets to record their level, stats, inventory, current and max heart points (HP), and more. To create a character, start by rolling `1d4-2` for the following stats: strength (`STR`), dexterity (`DEX`), constitution (`CON`), intelligence (`INT`), wisdom (`WIS`), and charisma (`CHA`). Then mark down their starting HP (`10+CON`), put `2d4` items in their inventory, and write a paragraph describing the character. The paragraph should be brief and include their personality (a virtue, a quirk, and a flaw), a note about their appearance, some history, and their goal/motivation(s).

### Dice Rolls

When the outcome of a character's action is uncertain, the GM will ask the player to make either an **action roll** or a **contested roll**. Action rolls are made by rolling `1d20+STAT` against the _Air of Fate_, a public target number that represents the difficulty of the task at hand. Some action rolls may be referred to as _checks_.

> _PC: I'll try and cross the rope inbetween the two buildings, like an acrobat.<br/>
> GM: Okay, make a dexterity check_ (`1d20+DEX`) _to see if you can do it without falling. The Air of Fate is still at 12._

Contested rolls happen when a player acts against an NPC, so `1d20+STAT` against `1d20+STAT`. For the player, a result that is higher than the target leads to a positive outcome, lower leads to a negative outcome, and a tie leads to a mixed outcome.

> _PC: I take my silver hammer and swing it at the werewolf's head.<br/>
> GM: Okay, make a strength check_ (`1d20+STR`) _and the werewolf will roll dexterity_ (`1d20+DEX`) _to try and dodge.<br/>_

### Heart Points

Players, NPCs, and even some objects have **heart points (HP)**, a number that represents a combination of physical, mental, and emotional integrity. Actions can be made to reduce or replenish a target's HP. On a successful roll, the actor will roll their **effect dice**, a specific combination of dice that changes as a character levels up, and increase or decrease the target's HP by the result. 

> _PC: I hit him!<br/>
> GM: Alright, roll your effect dice.<br/>
> PC: ...7?<br/>
> GM: The hammer cracks against the werewolf's face and it winces, but quickly recovers and looks like it wants revenge.<br/>
> PC: Aw, nuts..._
