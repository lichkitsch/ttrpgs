# dnduet

_dnduet_ is a system for creating and playing custom tabletop RPGs, optimized for one player and one game master (GM). The player is responsible for the story's protagonist(s), and the GM is responsible for just about everything else. Play is taken in turns: the GM presents the scene, environment, etc. and the player character (PC) will take actions that move the plot forward. 

## Player Guide

Characters in _dnduet_ games have character sheets that detail their level, stats, inventory, current and max heart points (HP), and more. To create a character, roll `1d4-2` for the following stats: strength (`STR`), dexterity (`DEX`), constitution (`CON`), intelligence (`INT`), wisdom (`WIS`), and charisma (`CHA`).
