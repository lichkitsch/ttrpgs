# dnduet player's guide

*dnduet* is a tabletop rpg system and a collaborative storytelling game for two: one player and one game master. The game master creates the setting, fills it with non-player characters (NPCs), and plot hooks to move the story along. The player makes choices and reacts to events in the narrative with their own character, who should be the central protagonist of the story you tell together.
