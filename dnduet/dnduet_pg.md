## Character Creation

Characters in _dnduet_ are built with stats and traits; stats are numbers that represent your aptitude in six particular areas while traits are narrative touchstones to inform your character's fears and desires. The six stats are listed below:

| name                                  | description                         |
|:-------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------- |
| <span title="strength">STR</span>     | power, muscle, athletics, melee     |
| <span title="dexterity">DEX</span>    | reflexes, agility, stealth, finesse |
| <span title="constitution">CON</span> | stamina, endurance, reroll HP       |
| <span title="intelligence">INT</span> | knowledge, memory, logic            |
| <span title="wisdom">WIS</span>       | perception, intuition, accuracy     |
| <span title="charisma">CHA</span>     | influence, performance, allure      |

Roll `1d4-2` for each stat to set its starting score. Find your starting maximum <span title="heart points">HP</span> by adding 10 to your `CON` score. 

Use your strengths and weaknesses to inform your character's personality, history, and appearance. Three personality traits (one positive, one neutral, and one negative) are easy to remember and can help you quickly determine how your character might respond to different situations. Your character's background should be easily summed up with a single sentence, although you can write as much as you want. Use your character's stats, personality, and history to inform their appearance and describe that as well.

Once your character has been created, and your game master has a setting and initial action to get you started, it's time to play!

## Playing the Game
_dnduet_ is a narrative game; the game master provides situations and choices to the player and the player makes choices and actions that move the story forward. When an action has an uncertain outcome, the outcome is decided by rolling dice.

- **Action Roll**: `1d20` + appropriate stat score, must be higher than or equal to the _Air of Fate_ for a positive outcome.
- _**Air of Fate**_: A number between 3 and 18 that marks the level of challenge for the situation at hand. This number fluctuates throughout the adventure but generally increases until the end.
- **Contested Roll**: An action roll which must be higher than or equal to a target's action roll, rather than the _Air of Fate_, for a positive outcome.

The story continues with the positive or negative consequences of the player's actions. It's up to the game master to provide opportunities for action rolls and character choices throughout the adventure.

## HP and Effect Dice
Sometimes an obstacle isn't overcome with one pass/fail action but instead takes a certain amount of effort to progress. In these situations the player must take turns making action rolls or contested rolls and use effect dice to reduce the obstacle's HP, or _heart points_, to zero before their positive outcome is achieved.

- **Heart Points (HP)**: A numerical representation of a creature or obstacle's physical, mental, and emotional integrity which is reduced or replenished through _effect dice_.
- **Effect Dice**: Rolled in a number of situations to determine the effectiveness of an action in terms of HP.
