# dnduet player guide

To play, you'll need:

1. A set of polyhedral dice
2. A game master with a quest
3. A completed character sheet

## Character
1. Roll `1d4-2` for each stat
    - `STR`, `DEX`, `CON`, `INT`, `WIS`, `CHA`
2. Starting MAX HP is 10+`CON`
3. Flesh out your character (personality, history, appearance, motivations, etc.)

## Character (cont.)


## Actions
Players describe the actions that their character takes to progress the story. Sometimes the outcome of an action is uncertain and you'll have to make an **action roll** to beat the _Air of Fate_, a number representing the level of challenge your character is currently facing.

Describe your character's action and roll `1d20`, then add the appropriate stat modifier to the result. If it's higher than or equal to the _Air of Fate_, the outcome is positive. If not, your character suffers a consequence.

## Contests
Sometimes creatures or obstacles will resist your character's actions directly. When creatures make actions against each other, both must make **contested** action rolls to reveal the outcome. The highest roll wins. In a tie, the outcome is a mixed result for both contestants.

## Heart Points
_dnduet_ uses a system called **heart points** to describe a creature or obstacle's integrity. To overcome something with HP you must make successful actions to decrease its HP
