# dnduet player guide

To play, you'll need:

1. A set of dice
    - `1d4`, `1d6`, `1d8`, `1d10`, `1d12`, `1d20`
2. A game master (GM) with a quest
3. A completed character sheet

## Character
1. Roll `1d4-2` for each stat
    - `STR`, `DEX`, `CON`, `INT`, `WIS`, `CHA`
2. Starting MAX HP is 10+`CON`
3. Flesh out your character (personality, history, appearance, motivations, etc.)

## Action Rolls
If the outcome of an action is uncertain, make an **action roll**. Describe your action and roll `1d20`, then add the appropriate stat. If the result is higher than or equal to the _Air of Fate_, the outcome is positive. If not, you suffer a consequence.

When creatures make actions against each other, both make **contested** action rolls to reveal the outcome. The highest roll wins. In a tie, the outcome is a mixed result for both contestants.

## Heart Points
_dnduet_ uses **heart points** to describe physical, mental, and emotional integrity. When an action roll to reduce a target's HP is successful, you roll **effect dice** and use the result to reduce the target's HP.

Sometimes items, magic, or a short rest will replenish a target's HP using **effect dice**. After a long rest (4+ hours) your HP is fully restored. You cannot rest if you are near danger. If a creature's HP reaches zero, they can no longer make action rolls and what happens next is up to the winner or the GM.

## Leveling Up
A character's level represents their ability to influence the world based on their power and experience, on a scale between 1 and 12. When you level up, roll the appropriate dice to increase your max HP and add 1 point to any stat. Each stat can have a max of 5 points. Also, make note of the effect dice for your new level.

## Inventory
You collect special items on your adventure that can hurt or help in the following ways:

- Add or subtract 1-3 points to specific action or effect rolls
- Advantage (roll twice, keep higher) or disadvantage (roll twice, keep lower) on specific rolls
- Reduce or replenish an effect roll's worth of HP when held or used
