# dnduet player guide

To play, you'll need:

1. A set of polyhedral dice
2. A game master with a quest
3. A completed character sheet

## Character
1. Roll `1d4-2` for each stat
    - `STR`, `DEX`, `CON`, `INT`, `WIS`, `CHA`
2. Starting MAX HP is 10+`CON`
3. Flesh out your character (personality, history, appearance, motivations, etc.)

## Action Rolls
Sometimes the outcome of an action is uncertain and you have to make an **action roll**. To make an action roll, describe your character's action and roll `1d20`, then add your most accurate stat. If it's higher than or equal to the _Air of Fate_, the outcome is positive. If not, your character suffers a consequence.

## Action Rolls (cont.)
When creatures make actions against each other, both make **contested** action rolls to reveal the outcome. The highest roll wins. In a tie, the outcome is a mixed result for both contestants.

## Heart Points
_dnduet_ uses **heart points** to describe physical, mental, and emotional integrity. When an action roll to reduce a target's HP is successful, you roll **effect dice** and use the result to reduce the target's HP.

Sometimes items, magic, or rest will replenish a target's HP using **effect dice**. After a long rest (4+ hours free from immediate danger) your HP returns to full. If a creature's HP reaches zero, they can no longer make action rolls and are at the mercy of the winner.

## Leveling Up


## Inventory
Your character will collect special items on their adventure that can hurt or help them in the following ways:

- Add or subtract 1-3 points to specific action or effect rolls
- Advantage (roll twice, keep higher) or disadvantage (roll twice, keep lower) on specific rolls
- Reduce or replenish an effect roll's worth of HP when held or used
