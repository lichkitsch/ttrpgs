## Guardian
The first "room" involves a challenge to even enter the area where the heart of the quest will take place, typically combat or puzzle.

## Puzzle
The second "room" tests the player's skills with a different type of challenge than the guardian, typically puzzle or roleplaying.

## Setback/Twist
The third "room" changes the nature of the quest and introduces a new element that increases the difficulty or hightens the risk of failure.

## Climax
The fourth "room" pits the player against the major conflict of the quest; the final boss that stands between the player and their current short-term goal.

## Revelation
The final "room" is the treasure room; there is some new piece of info that may lead the player in a new direction and kick off the next quest.
