# RINGLORD Adventure Planner

## Review
Describe the state of the party and their current situation.

## Important NPCs
List the important NPCs that the party might interact with including their name, description, motivation, and (if necessary) their stats.

## Goal
Give the party a clear, specific objective. The goal might be a red herring or lead to something bigger, but to take action your party needs to *want* something.

## Locations
Describe the areas available to the party. Note down three short words or phrases that describe (or at least hint at) the purpose and major features of the area, and include maps if you want.

## Obstacles
Describe the enemies, traps, puzzles, and other challenges that await the party. Include their location and mechanics.

## Revelations
Define ten secrets or clues that can be revealed during the adventure. Try to not tie them to specific events or moments, but instead drop them in when it's appropriate for the story.

## Dividends
Define the rewards (treasure, weapons, assets, etc.) the party will obtain for completing the adventure.
