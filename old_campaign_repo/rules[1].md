# How to Play dnduet
Role-playing games (RPGs) are all about collaborative storytelling, or at least they should be. This system provides a basic framework for creating and playing your own custom tabletop RPGs. You can swap out magic for alien technology or another special thing to fit your game's setting and genre, but for the most part these rules are kept relatively generic to allow for many styles of play in almost any setting.

The GM describes the setting and gives the players opportunities to make choices, attempt to complete tasks and overcome obstacles, and take actions that will move the narrative forward, while the players decide how they want their characters to react to the events of the story and roll dice to determine the outcome of any uncertain events.

## Actions and Attempts
The fluctuating level of difficulty in the game is represented by the *Air of Fate*, a target number between 8 and 18 everyone can see. When the player wants to do something they describe the action and roll `1d20`, adding any relevant bonuses or penalties, trying to get a result that is higher than the *Air of Fate*.

> The *Air of Fate* changes, increasing with the level of danger or difficulty the characters are facing and dropping to lower levels at times of rest.

There are actions, which are pass/fail, and there are tasks. Tasks have hit points (HP), visually represented by hearts, that must be reduced to zero before they are completed. Making a successful attempt at a task means the player can roll their effect dice (plus the effect bonus, if applicable), and subtract the result from the task's HP. 1 heart equals 10 HP, so a locked chest with 1 heart will take 10 effect to unlock it or break it open. This is also how combat works, at least against non-player characters (NPCs) and creatures. Think of "defeat a hostile target" as a task to complete, which could mean capturing them, forcing them to surrender, or killing them, depending on the context.

If a task is made on a willing party, such as healing a wounded ally, the action roll is optional and would only be taken if the actor wants to risk a failure for the chance at a critical roll. Otherwise the actor can assume success and skip to rolling for effect.

> Some tasks have conditions for attempts, such as using a specific trait or effect or only having one attempt per day. For example, Kilmaniorc the Barbarian Fighter cannot use their +4 strength to sing a magical song of healing.

## Traits and Effects
Actions and attempts are modified by bonuses and penalties, the simplest of which come in the form of character traits and effects. All characters and creatures have six traits and four effects, each with a number between -5 and 5 that indicates the bonus or penalty to rolls made with it. 

### Traits
| Name | Abbr. | Use |
| ----:|:-----:|:--- |
| Strength | STR | Power, muscle, athletics, and melee attacks |
| Dexterity | DEX | Agility, reflexes, stealth, sneak attacks and ranged attacks |
| Constitution | CON | Health, endurance, defense, and stamina |
| Intelligence | INT | Logic, memory, learning, and critical thinking |
| Wisdom | WIS | Willpower, faith, intuition, and perception |
| Charisma | CHA | Appeal, allure, leadership, and manipulation |

### Effects
Basic Effect
: Players roll `1d4` on all successful rolls, but they only add their basic effect score if the attempt is not aided by tools, magic, or a natural 20.

Tool Effect
: When a player is using a tool or weapon to aid in an attempt, they roll `1d4+1d6+TL` where TL is their tool effect score.

: > Poisons and potions count as tools, as do lockpicks, animal companions, and non-magical projectiles.

Magic Effect
: When a player is using magic to aid in an attempt, they roll `1d4+1d8+MG` where MG is their magic effect score.

: > Magic costs HP because it draws energy from the caster. When a player rolls for magic effect, they subtract the result of their `1d4` roll from their HP. If they know healing magic they might try to use their turn to heal themselves, but even healing magic costs HP to cast. Magic has a fickle, unpredictable nature in this game and should be used responsibly.

Critical Effect
: When a player makes an attempt and rolls a **natural 20** (a 20 before bonuses or penalties), they roll `1d4+1d12+CR` where CR is their critical effect score.

### Creating a Character
There are two methods to character creation: **point buy** and **random**.

Point Buy
: The **point buy** method provides the player with **5 points** to spend on any trait or effect they want. Points can be taken from traits or effects to increase the amount of points that can be distributed, but will leave the trait/effect with a penalty on those rolls. Again, no trait or effect can be lower than -5 or higher than 5.

Random
: Under the **random** method the player simply rolls `1d4-2` for each trait and effect, giving them starting scores of -1, +0, +1, or +2 at random. This is a riskier method and you can't get a starting bonus higher than +2 to any trait or effect, but it can definitely lead to some fun and interesting starting builds.

Once you have these basic stats, add details to describe your character like a name, backstory, profession, etc.

## Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes the task is easier or harder than expected based on the circumstances or situation at hand. Rather than changing the *Air of Fate*, the game master can apply advantage or disadvantage to a roll. Advantage means rolling `2d20` and keeping the higher result whereas disadvantage means rolling `2d20` and keeping the lower result. The effect that advantage and disadvantage have on a roll can be significant, so it should be used thoughtfully.

If the GM wants to give a minor advantage or disadvantage to a task, they can always call it "easy" or "hard" and just add or subtract 2 from the *Air of Fate* for attempts at that specific task. Just remember that the highest the *Air of Fate* can ever be is 18.

## Perks and Quirks
Characters start with **2 perks** and **2 quirks**. These are narrative, descriptive aspects of the character that give them unique strengths and weaknesses based on their shape, history, ancestry, studies, training, divine favor/disdain, etc. 

Perks and quirks have effects that apply under specific circumstances. For example, perks might include wings for flight, +2 damage when attacking undead creatures, or advantage on all sneak attacks. Quirks, on the other hand, could include things like a paralyzing fear or fire, -2 armor in hot climates, or disadvantage on intimidation attempts.

Perks and quirks are story-based. When the character makes a significant choice or acts in a particularly risky or life-altering way, the GM can remove, augment, or add a perk/quirk to your character. They might be temporary ("deafened by explosion") or permanent ("lost an eye"), but players should ***always*** be warned ahead of time when a choice they are making or an action they are taking might have a lasting effect on their character.

## Items and Inventory
Characters carry helpful objects with them such as currency, clothing, armor, tools, weapons, spellbooks, potions, and more. Keep track of the things to which your character has access and update this list as they gain and lose items throughout their journey. Some special items might increase your character's ability to avoid damage, heal a certain amount of HP, or reduce the cost for spellcasting. Keep the item's effect low, and if it does have a high effect consider adding a cost to using the item in the form of trait/effect penalties, receiving disadvantage more often, etc. 

> The GM and PCs should work together to tell the best story possible, not to compete with one another.

## Armor and HP
Every character has armor and hit points (HP). Hostile creatures in the game world might attack the PCs, but to land an attack and deal damage they must roll higher than your character’s armor, which is 10 plus bonuses/penalties from the character's dexterity or constitution, the armor they are wearing, and their perks/quirks. A character's armor cannot be higher than 18. 

Characters start with 10+CON as their maximum HP. For characters, HP represents the amount of damage they can take before they fall unconscious. On their turn, an unconscious character rolls `1d20`. On a critical hit they wake on their own with 1 HP. If they roll a critical fail they permanently lose one point of their constitution bonus. Allies and NPCs can help the character by healing them, defending them, or removing them from danger, but if their HP reaches -10 or they roll a critical fail with a constitution of -1 or less, they die.

How your group handles death is up to you. Do they continue adventuring as a ghost? Will the party brave the spectral plane to retrieve their ally? Or was their death honorable and they pass on to the next life? Maybe it's a darker story and the character is gone forever, with no chance of bringing them back. You, as a group, decide.

## Failure
If a character doesn’t roll higher than the *Air of Fate* the GM can resolve the failure one of two ways: introduce a narrative twist or add a temporary quirk. Twists change the situation and give the player new choices, whereas quirks act as a cost for the action’s success. For example, a failed roll when attempting to leap over a gap could result in an enemy appearing on the other side of the gap before the character makes the jump, but could also result in the character landing on the other side while sustaining a temporary "sprained ankle" quirk. 

> The "Sprained Ankle" quirk might inflict `1d4` damage on the character when landing from a moderately high jump until they have time to rest and heal.

If the player rolls a natural 1, the quirk they take becomes permanent and will take a much more significant narrative milestone to remove.

## Character Progression
When the PCs accomplish something great, such as at the end of an story arc or after a significant victory, the GM might let them level up. This means they add `2d4` to their max HP and receive 1 extra point to apply to a trait or effect. 

> Characters can re-roll one of the `2d4` HP increase dice for each bonus CON point they have.

Characters should grow and change throughout the game, not necessarily at specific intervals. If a PC gets to be level 20, they no longer receive additional HP or bonus points, and are considered to be at their most powerful, having met their potential. Whatever this means to your character or your group is up to you. The character might rule a kingdom, mentor a new generation of adventurers, or lives out the rest of their days on a private island. Maybe their feats have attracted the attention of some higher entity who either challenges them, rewards them, or teleports them to a new realm where they enter a whole new level of challenge and start fresh on the progression track, losing the benefits they earned in their old life. 

Get creative and have fun!
