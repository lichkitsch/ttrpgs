# dnduet
*dnduet* is a tabletop roleplaying system optimized for play between only 1 player and 1 dungeon master (DM). *dnduet* is not about winning or competing with one another, but about collaborative storytelling. The player controls a character (or multiple) living in an imaginary world, which is controlled by the DM. The DM describes the environment and potential problems the PC (player character) must solve. The player can do whatever they want, however, if the action they want to take has a chance of failure, the player must roll dice to determine the outcome.

## Attempts
When the player wants to do something to progress the story, but it's unclear if the action will succeed or not, the DM will ask the player to make an **attempt roll**. Attempt rolls are made by rolling `1d20`, adding the appropriate **trait score**, and checking the result against the *Air of Fate*. That was a lot of vocabulary, so let me take a moment to break it down:

### 1d20
The first number is the amount of dice to roll. The "d" represents dice, obviously. And the number following the "d" is the number of faces on the die you need to roll. *dnduet* Core requires one of each of the following: d4, d6, d8, d10, d%, d12, and d20.

### Trait
Characters and creatures in dnduet have 6 traits: strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, and charisma. These traits are something of a standard in the tabletop RPG world, and are sometimes called attributes or ability scores. When first creating a character, you'll roll `1d4-2` for each trait to find it's starting score. This will also tell you your character's strengths and weaknesses. Feel free to swap scores around between the traits if you have a specific type of character you were looking forward to playing. Traits also become stronger as you level up.

### *Air of Fate*
This is a target number between 8 and 25 that represents the level of difficulty for the current scene, room, or obstacle. The *Air of Fate* tends to be lower during times of rest and higher during times of conflict. Rolls against the *Air of Fate* might also be **easy** (AoF-3) or **hard** (AoF+3) depending on the circumstances, previous attempts, etc. Obstacles can also have their own *Air of Fate*, depending on their level of difficulty.
