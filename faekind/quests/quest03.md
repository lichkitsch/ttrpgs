Jacob is sick and needs the spellbook to find the dure. He has most of what he needs, but he's missing two ingredients: butterfly powder and purple pepper flakes. He directs Sorrel to an apothecary near the sprawl.

The apothecary wants to "read" Fox as payment for the ingredients. If Sorrel convinces him to do it, the apothecary privately tells Fox that his parents didn't abandon him, he was taken from them.

Fox follows through the rest of healing Jacob but then decides he needs to quit his job and guard Sorrel full-time, to find out more about her strange world.
