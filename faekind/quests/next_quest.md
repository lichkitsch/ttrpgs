After leaving the club, Fern apologizes because she wants to go back and spend time with Ash. She leaves Sorrel alone with Fox to take her home. Fox had a good time at the club but describes the atmosphere as "slightly off", giving Sorrel the impression that he might have seen something he shouldn't have seen.

_Episode will likely focus on Sorrel and Fox talking on the way home, with Fox asking prodding questions and responding cryptically to Sorrel's questions. There are things that Sorrel can trigger, but rather than constantly throw hooks at her, I'd prefer to encourage her to make the choices about what to pursue or avoid. She's not an adventurer, per say, and being a person-of-interest in the city makes it difficult to justify making her do anything that she can't enlist someone more suited to do it for her. Sorrel needs to be made responsible for something, something she actually cares about, to up the stakes and drive the story forward._      

### Hooks

- The salamander underneath Sanguine
- Dahlia with recording
- Two days left for threat
- Jacob containing prisoner problem
- Still no info on Jasper or the smugglers

On their way to Sorrel's home, make a travel roll:

| Roll | Outcome |
|:---:|:--- |
| &gt; AoF | A light drizzle starts while Fox and Sorrel walk back to the tower, prompting some puddle-splashing fun |
| = AoF | Fox admits that the club had a strange atmosphere and questions Sorrel about her friends |
| &lt; AoF | A storm kicks up and Fox wants to wait it out in a taxi; the driver is Unseelie, recognizes Sorrel, and refuses service, prompting a difficult question from Fox (what was that about?) |

Sorrel may want to go to the place listed on the map, but would maybe want to wait for Fern? Fox wants Sorrel to make safe decisions, stay home kind of thing. Maybe Sorrel wants to sneak out and fight at the sprawl? Jacob could show back up with some new info. Maybe he wants to apologize again and explain something about a possible agent working away at his bubble prisons?

Jacob will probably want Sorrel to act as bait and go through the portal again or, failing that, request that she enlist Fern to be bait (in tightening up the security, jacob made it so travel will only work with someone who's been there already).
