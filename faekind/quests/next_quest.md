After leaving the club, Fern apologizes because she wants to go back and spend time with Ash. She leaves Sorrel alone with Fox to take her home. Fox had a good time at the club but describes the atmosphere as "slightly off", giving Sorrel the impression that he might have seen something he shouldn't have seen.
