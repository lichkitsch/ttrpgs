# Launch Party
Fern's friend requested that Sorrel play at the opening night of her club, for pay of course. The club, Sanguine, sits near the Sprawl and is meant as a safe, friendly place for Fae. Dogwood uses music to create a magical area within the building to help galmourize the crowd. Fox is joining Fern and Sorrel as Sorrel's new bodyguard. On their way to the club they've run into a frazzled Hemlock.

1. Redd still in hospital
2. Acquired address from secret map (across the river, in Blackwood territory)
3. Hemlock and Oyster are looking for Beech, but Hemlock doesn't want to admit it
4. Threat ~2 days away
