# Paragon City
Paragon City is based on a lakeside metropolis like Chicago or Detroit; bustling and growing on top of decades of old bones, constant "clean up" projects and a clear and ever-present class divide. The city is split up officially into 23 districts and unofficially into 4 territories: the Seelie Court, the Blackwood territory, the Thornfrost territory, and two "neutral zones" where the three powers have an understanding and investment in peace.
