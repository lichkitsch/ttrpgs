# _dnduet_

You'll need:

1. A player with a completed character sheet (PC)
2. A game master (GM) with a quest (and notes)
3. A set of RPG dice or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dice+roller" target="_blank">a digital alternative</a>
4. A copy of these rules


## Action Rolls
There are three kinds of actions that a player can take in _dnduet_: free actions, skill checks, and contested rolls.

- Free Action - The outcome is certain, no roll needed.
- Skill Check - The outcome is uncertain, roll `1d20` and add one stat modifier to the result. Check the result against the _`Air of Fate`_ (AoF) to determine the outcome. The _`Air of Fate`_ is a number between 2 and 20 that represents the difficulty of an area or obstacle.
   - Result > AoF = Positive outcome
   - Result = AoF = Mixed outcome
   - Result < AoF = Negative outcome
- Contested Rolls - If the target can resist, both the player and the GM roll skill checks for opposing actions.
  - Treat the GM's result as a temporary _`Air of Fate`_.
  
## Heart Points
Every character and some obstacles in _dnduet_ have heart points (HP) that represent a combination of physical, mental, and emotional integrity. When an action that would reduce or replenish the HP of a target is successful, the actor rolls their _`Effect Dice`_ to see how much effect the action had on the target's HP. When HP reaches zero the character can no longer act or the obstacle has been overcome.
