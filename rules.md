# _dnduet_

You'll need:

1. A player with a completed character sheet (PC)
2. A game master (GM) with a quest (and notes)
3. A set of RPG dice or <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=dice+roller" target="_blank">a digital alternative</a>
4. A copy of these rules


## Action Rolls
There are three kinds of actions that a player can take in _dnduet_: free actions, skill checks, and contested rolls.

- Free Action - The outcome is certain, no roll needed.
- Skill Check - The outcome is uncertain, roll 1d20 and add one stat modifier to the result. If the final number is higher than the _Air of Fate_, the outcome is positive. If equal, the outcome is mixed, and if lower, the outcome is negative.
   - The _Air of Fate_ is a number between 2 and 20 that represents the difficulty of an area or obstacle.
- Contested Rolls - If the target can resist, both the player and the GM roll skill checks for opposing actions.
  - Treat the GM's result as a temporary _Air of Fate_.
  
## Heart Points
Every character and some obstacles in _dnduet_ have heart points (HP) that represent a combination of physical, mental, and emotional integrity. When an action that would reduce or replenish the HP of a target is successful, the actor rolls special "effect dice" to see how much effect the action had on the target's HP. When HP reaches zero the character can no longer act or the obstacle has been overcome.
